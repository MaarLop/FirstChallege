## Login:

There isn't a defined user to login. You can type any password and user name to start. 

Also you can login with your Google account, clicking the Login with Google button.

For getting user information like avatar an user name, I use a fake random user API. Every login will have a different nickname or avatar.

## Deploy

The app isn't deployed in Heroku yet.

## Run Application

You have to run `ng serve --o` in command line.
